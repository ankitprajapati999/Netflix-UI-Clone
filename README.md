## 💡 What This Is

This isn’t a Netflix app — it’s the landing page vibe:

* Hero header that says *“This looks familiar…”*
* Slick responsive layout
* Effects that don’t suck
* Built with HTML & CSS like an absolute unit

It’s lightweight, clean, and looks way more expensive than the codebase.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Because frameworks are fun, but fundamentals are **rad**.
This project proves:

> You can make non-trivial UI without a single JS line.

Frontend magic isn’t about tools — it’s about knowing how the browser actually works.

## 🚀 How to Use

Just clone and open it in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitprajapati999/Netflix-UI-Clone.git
cd Netflix-UI-Clone
open index.html
```

Boom. Instant Netflix-but-not-Netflix.
